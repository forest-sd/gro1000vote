    <article class="section"><h2>Why Local Elections Matter More Than You Think</h2>
      <p>While national elections dominate headlines and social media feeds, it's local elections that most directly impact your daily life. Your city council decides your property taxes. Your school board shapes your children's education. Your county commission determines road maintenance, public safety staffing, and land use decisions that affect your neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Yet local election turnout is shockingly low. Municipal elections in the United States typically see turnout rates between 15-27% of eligible voters, compared to 60%+ for presidential elections. This means a small number of engaged citizens are making decisions that affect everyone.</p>
      <p>The impact of local government is immediate and tangible. When your street gets plowed after a snowstorm, when a new park opens in your neighborhood, when zoning changes allow a new business to open — these are all local government decisions. The officials making these choices are often elected by just a few hundred or thousand votes.</p>
      <p>Getting informed about local elections requires different strategies than following national politics. Attend city council meetings, read local newspapers, visit candidate websites, and participate in community forums. Many local candidates are accessible and eager to discuss their platforms with constituents.</p>
      <p>Your vote carries enormous weight in local elections. In many municipal races, the margin of victory is measured in dozens or hundreds of votes, not thousands. Your participation — and the participation of your neighbors — can literally determine the direction of your community.</p>
