    <article class="section"><h2>Getting Involved Beyond Voting: A Citizen's Guide</h2>
      <p>Voting is the foundation of democratic participation, but it's far from the only way to engage with your community and influence the decisions that affect your life. A truly engaged citizen participates in democracy year-round, not just on election day.</p>
      <p>Attending public meetings is one of the most impactful things you can do. City council meetings, school board sessions, planning commission hearings, and town halls are all open to the public. Your presence and voice in these settings directly influence decision-makers who are accountable to their constituents.</p>
      <p>Volunteering for campaigns — whether for a candidate, ballot measure, or civic organization — multiplies your impact. Phone banking, canvassing, voter registration drives, and election day poll monitoring are all critical activities that keep democracy functioning.</p>
      <p>Contacting your elected representatives is more effective than most people realize. A thoughtful letter, email, or phone call from a constituent carries significant weight, especially at the local and state level. Elected officials track constituent communications and use them to gauge public opinion on key issues.</p>
      <p>Serving on local boards and commissions is an often-overlooked pathway to civic impact. Most communities have dozens of appointed positions on planning commissions, parks boards, library boards, and advisory committees. These roles provide direct influence over community decisions and require no election.</p>
      <p>Finally, simply staying informed and sharing knowledge with your community is a form of civic engagement. When you help a neighbor understand a ballot measure, drive someone to register to vote, or facilitate a conversation about local issues, you're strengthening the fabric of democracy.</p>
