    <article class="section"><h2>The Complete Guide to Voter Registration</h2>
      <p>Voter registration is the essential first step in exercising your democratic rights. While the process varies by state, understanding the fundamentals ensures that nothing stands between you and the ballot box on election day.</p>
      <p>In the United States, most citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote, but registration is required in every state except North Dakota. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 simplified the process by requiring states to offer registration at DMV offices, public assistance agencies, and through mail-in forms.</p>
      <p>Online voter registration is now available in most states, making the process faster and more accessible than ever. Simply visit your state's election website, provide your name, address, date of birth, and identification number, and submit your application. Most states process registrations within 2-4 weeks.</p>
      <p>Registration deadlines vary significantly by state. Some states require registration 30 days before an election, while others offer same-day registration at polling places. Checking your state's specific deadline well in advance of any election is crucial.</p>
      <p>Keep your registration current. If you move, change your name, or want to update your party affiliation, you'll need to update your registration. Many states allow these changes online, and the process is typically straightforward.</p>
      <p>Remember: registration is not a one-time event. Periodically verify your registration status, especially before major elections. Voter purges and administrative errors can sometimes remove eligible voters from the rolls without notification.</p>
