    <section class="section"><h2>About Gro1000Vote</h2>
      <p>Gro1000Vote was founded on the belief that an engaged citizenry is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy. Too many eligible voters sit out elections — not because they don't care, but because they feel uninformed, disconnected, or powerless. We exist to change that.</p>
      <p>Our organization works at the grassroots level to register voters, educate communities about issues on the ballot, and create pathways for meaningful civic participation beyond election day. We believe that democracy is a muscle that must be exercised regularly.</p>
      <p>We are nonpartisan in our approach. We don't endorse candidates or parties — we endorse participation. Our goal is to ensure that every eligible citizen has the information, access, and motivation to make their voice heard at the ballot box and in their community.</p></section>
